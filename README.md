# Exercisms

Performing Exercisms on Twitch. May the power of programming compel you! Starting with Kotlin then will be moving to Go lang then Rust (probably).

My solutions are in this repository but they can also be seen on [my Exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/techygrrrl/solutions).

## Perform Exercisms with Me!

Join us on Twitch at https://twitch.tv/techygrrrl where I sometimes code algorithms (but mostly projects), and sometimes gaming.

To be ready:

1. Join the Exercism platform
2. Install the CLI â€“ [read the walkthrough](https://exercism.org/cli-walkthrough)
3. Solve the sample [hello-world problem in Kotlin](https://exercism.org/tracks/kotlin/exercises/hello-world) and submit it to the platform via the CLI
4. Click the **Mark as Complete** button so it counts towards your progress and profile reputation

Here's the Kotlin track: https://exercism.org/tracks/kotlin
